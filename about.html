                    <p><strong>(Voted on) By Locals..</strong> is more than just a list of restaurants. It's an idea. The idea that the best recommendations come from the people who know a city best: the people who live there.</p>
                    <p>We started this as a simple social experiment because we were tired of the endless scrolling, the sponsored posts, and the algorithm-optimized lists on mainstream review sites. We wanted a simple, honest answer to the question, "Where should we eat tonight?"</p>
